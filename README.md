Creates a square grid using CSS grid and javascript that changes each square background color to black when the mouse passes over. There are also buttons that change the size of the grid according to user input and change the background color to a random RBG color (Rainbow Mode) as the mouse passes over each square. DOM manipulation and Javascript are used to do this.
